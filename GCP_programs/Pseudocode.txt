#Bubble Sort
repeat

    if the keys are in the wrong order then
        swap the keys

#Replace every 3 element of an array to 10
Set loopcounter to 0
for every third element in the array
    replace the existing value with 10
    increment loopcounter by 3

======================================================================
#Quick sort
Make any element as pivot
Partition the array on the basis of pivot
Apply quick sort on left partition recursively
Apply quick sort on right partition recursively


#Fibonacci
Initialise n to fifty
Initialise sum to zero
Initialise a and b to zero
repeat n times
	add a and b, store this value in sum
	assign a current value to b
	assign sum current value to a
end loop
