start the program
    comment char num
    declare num character
    now we will input this character from the machine
    input num
    Checking if the number we got is divisible by 13 using modulus operator and printing the same
    if num % 13 = 0
        we are printing here
        print The number is divisible by 13
    else
        print Number not divisible by 13
    endif
end program
